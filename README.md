# Algorithm-
Comparative analysis of Univariate Linear Regression algorithms: Using a randomly generated linear 
dataset, approximated the best fit line using both the analytical and numerical approach (in Python). Comparisons were 
drawn on the basis of residuals (errors) by hyperparameter tuning (Learning rates) and Error optimization (Cost function 
Vs Iterations curve)
